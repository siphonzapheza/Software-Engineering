Project Overview

Tender Insight Hub is a cloud-native SaaS platform designed to help South African SMEs efficiently navigate public procurement opportunities.

The system aims to:

Simplify complex tender documents

Provide AI-powered summarization and readiness scoring

Enable team-based collaboration across different pricing tiers

The backend is implemented using FastAPI, with SQL (MySQL) for structured data and NoSQL (MongoDB) for unstructured data like summaries and logs. The system simulates a modern production-grade application.
